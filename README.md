## design principles  
- simple foundational systems that leave room for the company to be adaptive
- lives beyond the developer(s) use case

## todo  
~~setup a git~~  
~~refactor to Monolith~~  
~~setup truffle~~  
~~test buyRelease function~~  
~~refactor (now that I've gone through and packed all the features in)~~
~~test real gas prices / where to deploy this contract?~~
~~cap credits on new project~~
~~drop credit if single perm dev is a soft-lock~~
front-end!
share/refine/harden  
look into fallback functions  

better consensus functionality?  
add dev to project (require consensus)?  
new project requires consensus?  
how to undo damage? migration?


## cmds
